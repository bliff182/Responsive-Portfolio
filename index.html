            To everyone reading, my name is Mike, as you can see up there. I never know what to write about myself in
            these types of things so I guess I'll start with the basics. I grew up in Cranford, NJ, graduated from
            Cranford High School in 2008, and went on to graduate from Rutgers University in 2012 with a degree in
            Marketing. Naturally, that marketing degree led me to work in the field of IT, in which I have worked for
            five years.
        </p>

            A couple of years after graduating, I moved to New York City where I have been working in a helpdesk
            position for a real estate firm. Let's get one thing straight, NYC ain't cheap, and helpdesk positions don't
            pay all that well. While I have enjoyed my employment over the years, I found myself wanting to branch out
            and expand my skillset, which led to my interest in web development. After teaching myself some basics over
            the years, I enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp with the goal of gaining the knowledge and skills I
            need to pursue a new career in web development.

            And now for something completely different: My hobbies include playing guitar, watching far more movies and
            TV shows than the average person, being absolutely insufferable about said movies and TV shows, and yelling
            at the TV during Devils, Giants, and Yankee games. My biggest concern with this course is that hockey season
            is about to start; I'm really hoping it doesn't significantly distract me from my coding responsibilities. I
            will certainly make every attempt to not let that happen but I'm telling you right now I can't make any
            promises.
